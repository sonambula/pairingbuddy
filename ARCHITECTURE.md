# Pairing Buddy Architecture

> Your pair programming companion for test-driven development and clean architecture.

> **Migration in progress:** on branch `spike/dynamic-workflows`, orchestration is moving to Workflow scripts. The target architecture is in [docs/architecture/workflow-orchestration.md](docs/architecture/workflow-orchestration.md). This document will be rewritten from it when the migration's cleanup slice lands.

## Overview

Pairing Buddy is a Claude Code plugin that orchestrates Test-Driven Development (TDD) workflows through specialized agents. It migrated from a nested skill-based architecture to a flat agent architecture with Python pseudocode workflows and JSON contracts.

**Core principle:** A skill acts as orchestrator in the main context, invoking self-contained plugin agents via the Task tool. Agents communicate through JSON state files, creating a predictable, testable, and extensible system.

---

## Design Philosophy

### Separation of Concerns: WHAT vs HOW

**Agents define WHAT to do at a high level.** They do NOT include:
- Language-specific syntax (e.g., pytest patterns, JUnit annotations)
- Framework-specific patterns (e.g., Arrange-Act-Assert, Given-When-Then)
- Testing strategies (e.g., "use mocks", "use fixtures")
- Implementation details (e.g., "use parameterized tests")

**Skills provide language/framework-specific HOW via progressive disclosure.** This enables:
- **Extensibility by design**: Add new languages (Java, JavaScript, Go) without changing agents
- **Framework flexibility**: Support multiple testing frameworks (pytest, unittest, JUnit, Jest)
- **Separation of concerns**: Agent logic is stable; skill content evolves

### TDD as First-Class Citizen

The entire architecture is built around the RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle:
1. **RED**: Write failing tests first (tests should fail because production code doesn't exist or doesn't match spec)
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to make tests pass (no gold-plating)
3. **REFACTOR**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

### Human Checkpoints

The system includes human review points to prevent:
- Runaway automated changes
- Infinite refactoring loops
- Coverage loss during refactoring
- Misaligned implementations

### Orchestrator-Agent Pattern

The architecture follows a clear separation:

```
/pairingbuddy:code or /pairingbuddy:plan or /pairingbuddy:design-ux command
    ↓
orchestrator skill (coding, planning, or designing-ux - main context)
    ↓ (interprets Python pseudocode workflow)
    ↓
Task tool: pairingbuddy:<agent-name>
    ↓
Agent reads input JSON → performs operation → writes output JSON
    ↓
Orchestrator reads output, determines next step
    ↓
Repeat...
```

**Key constraints:**
- Skills can invoke agents (via Task tool)
- Agents cannot invoke other agents (by design)
- TDD state passes through JSON files in `.pairingbuddy/`
- Plan state passes through JSON files in `.pairingbuddy/plan/`
- Design UX state passes through JSON files in `.pairingbuddy/design-ux/{name}/`

### Session Drift Guardian

Long Claude Code sessions tend to drift — the session agent starts skipping workflow steps, doing agent work in the main context, or rationalizing its way out of following the pseudocode. The guardian is a hook-based mechanism that periodically re-injects a workflow compliance reminder.

**How it works:**
- `PostToolUse` hook fires after every tool call (the universal activity heartbeat)
- If 5+ minutes have elapsed since the last injection, the guardian injects the reminder
- After context compaction (`SessionStart:compact`), always inject — instructions may have been lost
- No injection during idle periods (event-driven, no polling, no token waste)

**State:** Injection timestamps are stored per session in `.pairingbuddy/hooks/{session-id}.json`.

**Design constraints:**
- The guardian runs as an external process, not controllable by the session agent
- No activation signal needed — injects regardless of whether a workflow is active (the cost is 4 lines of harmless text)
- Time-based, not count-based — adapts naturally to both rapid agent bursts and slow interactive sessions

### State Management

State files live in `.pairingbuddy/` at the git root of the target project:

| State File | Purpose | Schema |
|------------|---------|--------|
| task.json | User's coding task description | task.schema.json |
| task-classification.json | Classified task type | task-classification.schema.json |
| test-config.json | Test runner configuration (persists) | test-config.schema.json |

| docs-updated.json | Documentation updates made | docs-updated.schema.json |

**Planning state files** (in `.pairingbuddy/plan/`):

| State File | Purpose | Schema |
|------------|---------|--------|
| plan-config.json | Plan name, output path, existing docs (persists) | plan-config.schema.json |
| plan-requirements.json | Structured requirements from brainstorming | plan-requirements.schema.json |
| plan-architecture.json | Architectural context and decisions | plan-architecture.schema.json |
| plan-tracer-bullets.json | Tracer bullet decomposition | plan-tracer-bullets.schema.json |

**Design UX state files** (in `.pairingbuddy/design-ux/{name}/`):

| State File | Purpose | Schema |
|------------|---------|--------|
| session.json | Active explorations and gallery config | design-session.schema.json |
| direction.json | Design brief and constraints | design-direction.schema.json |
| domain-spec.json | Domain grounding and design intent | domain-spec.schema.json |

| tokens-generated.json | Token generation status | tokens-generated.schema.json |
| config.json | Design system configuration | design-system-config.schema.json |
| critique.json | Design evaluation results | design-critique.schema.json |
| validation.json | Structural validation results | design-validation.schema.json |
| gallery-output.json | Gallery generation output | gallery-output.schema.json |

### Flow

The workflow is defined as Python pseudocode in the orchestrator skill. The orchestrator interprets this and invokes agents accordingly.

**New Feature Flow:**
```
task → classify_task → enumerate_scenarios_and_test_cases
                              ↓
                       create_test_placeholders
                              ↓
                       [for each test]
                          implement_tests (RED)
                              ↓
                          implement_code (GREEN)
                              ↓
                          identify_test_issues → refactor_tests
                              ↓
                          identify_code_issues → refactor_code
                              ↓
                       verify_test_coverage
                              ↓ (loop if gaps found)
                       run_all_tests
                              ↓
                       commit_changes
```

**Task Types:**
| Task Type | Description | Workflow |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **new_feature** | Adding new functionality | Full TDD with coverage verification loop |
| **bug_fix** | Fixing incorrect behavior | Regression test + fix |
| **refactoring** | Improving structure | Verify tests pass → scope → refactor → verify |
| **config_change** | Configuration only | Make change → verify tests pass |
| **spike** | Exploratory coding | Setup → explore units → document findings |

**Spike Flow:**
```
task → classify_task → setup_spike
                            ↓
                     [for each unit]
                        explore_spike_unit
                            ↓
                     (human checkpoint)
                            ↓
                     document_spike (mandatory)
```

The spike workflow is for exploratory coding without TDD - answering questions, comparing approaches, or evaluating technologies. Each exploration unit can have its own language/runtime configuration.

**Design UX Flow:**
```
/pairingbuddy:design-ux → designing-ux orchestrator
                                ↓
                         design_ux_explorer (domain grounding)
                                ↓
                         design_ux_architect (design decisions)
                                ↓
                         design_ux_token_generator (three-tier tokens)
                                ↓
                         design_ux_visual_builder (preview + example HTML)
                                ↓
                         design_ux_critic (6-pass evaluation)
                                ↓ (iterate if issues found)
                         design_ux_validator (structural validation)
                                ↓
                         design_ux_gallery_generator (comparison gallery)
```

The design UX workflow creates production-ready design systems with three-tiered token architecture (global → alias → component). It supports parallel explorations with isolated state per exploration, Playwright-based visual feedback, and web-hostable output.

**Plan Flow:**
```
/pairingbuddy:plan → planning orchestrator
                          ↓
                   brainstorm_requirements (adaptive Socratic exploration)
                          ↓ [human checkpoint]
                   solidify_architecture (create/update arch docs)
                          ↓ [human checkpoint]
                   decompose_tracer_bullets (thin E2E slices)
                          ↓ [human checkpoint]
                   sequence_tasks (rich task descriptions, writes plan MD)
                          ↓ [human checkpoint]
                   Plan complete → human points /code at plan MD
```

The planning workflow produces a markdown plan document with checkboxes ready for `/code` execution. Each task is self-contained with goal, acceptance criteria, and context links. Plan state lives in `.pairingbuddy/plan/`, isolated from `/code`'s cleanup.

**Plan Execution Flow (via `/code`):**
```
/pairingbuddy:code (with plan MD path)
    ↓
_detect_plan_file → _read_plan_tasks → _hydrate_claude_tasks
    ↓
[for each unchecked task]
    Write task.json → normal TDD workflow
        ↓
    _mark_task_complete (update MD checkbox)
        ↓
    _update_claude_task (mark visible task done)
        ↓
    [human checkpoint between tasks]
```

When `/code` receives a plan MD file, it enters plan execution mode: iterates through unchecked tasks, runs the TDD workflow for each, updates checkboxes, and provides visibility via Claude Code Tasks. Cross-session recovery reads the MD checkboxes to determine progress.

---

## Testing Philosophy

Pairing Buddy enforces a rigorous TDD philosophy for the projects it works on. This section describes the testing principles the system applies.

### RED-GREEN-REFACTOR Cycle

The Three Laws of TDD (Kent Beck):
1. **Don't write production code until you have a failing test**
2. **Don't write more test than sufficient to fail**
3. **Don't write more production code than sufficient to pass**

The cycle:
```
   RED                    GREEN                   REFACTOR
┌─────────┐           ┌─────────┐           ┌─────────────┐
│  Write  │    →      │ Write   │    →      │  Improve    │
│ failing │           │ minimal │           │   code      │
│  test   │           │  code   │           │  quality    │
└─────────┘           └─────────┘           └─────────────┘
     ↑                                            │
     └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**RED Phase (implement-tests agent):**
- Test should fail because production code doesn't exist or doesn't match spec
- Verify tests fail for the RIGHT reason (feature not implemented, API missing)
- Wrong failures (syntax errors, import errors) indicate bad tests - fix and retry

**GREEN Phase (implement-code agent):**
- Write MINIMAL code to make tests pass
- No gold-plating, no refactoring (that comes later)
- If test seems impossible to satisfy, ask human operator

**REFACTOR Phase (identify-*-issues + refactor-* agents):**
- Improve code quality while keeping tests green
- Apply Clean Code principles, SOLID, remove smells
- Human checkpoint: continue, skip remaining, or stop

### Test Terminology

Pairing Buddy uses precise terminology for test organization:

| Term | Definition | Example | Granularity |
|------|------------|---------|-------------|
| **Scenario** | High-level what to test (a feature/behavior area) | "User can log in" | 1 per feature |
| **Test Case** | Specific condition to verify within a scenario | "Login with valid credentials succeeds" | Many per scenario |
| **Test** | Actual code that implements a test case | `def test_login_valid_credentials():` | 1+ per test case |

**Relationships:**
```
Scenario (1) → Test Cases (many) → Tests (1+ per test case)

Example:
Scenario: "Calculator addition"
├── Test Case: "Adding two positive numbers"
│   └── Test: test_add_positive_numbers()
├── Test Case: "Adding negative numbers"
│   └── Test: test_add_negative_numbers()
└── Test Case: "Overflow handling"
    └── Test: test_add_overflow()
```

This hierarchy enables:
- **Traceability**: Every test maps back to a test case and scenario
- **Coverage verification**: Compare implemented tests against enumerated scenarios
- **Gap analysis**: Identify missing test cases during coverage checks

### FIRST Principles

Every test should follow F.I.R.S.T.:

| Principle | Meaning | Implementation |
|-----------|---------|----------------|
| **Fast** | Milliseconds, not seconds | Use fakes, not real databases |
| **Independent** | No shared state between tests | Each test runs in isolation |
| **Repeatable** | Same result in any environment | Local, CI, offline |
| **Self-validating** | Pass/fail via assertions | No manual inspection needed |
| **Timely** | Written before production code | TDD practice |

### Four-Phase Test Structure

Every test follows: **Setup, Exercise, Verify, Teardown** (SEVT):

```python
def test_retries_failed_operations():
    # Setup
    attempts = []
    def operation():
        attempts.append(1)
        if len(attempts) < 3:
            raise ConnectionError("failed")
        return "success"

    # Exercise
    result = retry_operation(operation)

    # Verify
    assert result == "success"
    assert len(attempts) == 3

    # Teardown (implicit or explicit)
```

**Conventions:**
- Use blank lines to separate phases, not comments
- Name the System Under Test `sut` for easy identification
- One assertion concept per test (ideally)

### Test Status Verification

The implement-tests agent verifies tests fail/pass for the RIGHT reason:

| Status | Meaning | Expected When |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| `failing_correctly` | Feature not implemented, code path missing, API doesn't exist | RED phase (good) |
| `failing_wrong_reason` | Syntax error, import error, unexpected exception | Bad test, needs fix |
| `passing` | Test passes | GREEN phase, or unexpected in RED |
| `error` | Test could not run at all | Runner error, environment issue |

**Critical:** A test failing for the wrong reason is not progress - it's a bug in the test.

## Testing Strategy for Pairing Buddy Itself

Pairing Buddy was built using BDD/TDD, outside-in development, with a focus on structure and contracts rather than behavior.

### BDD Approach: Outer to Inner

**Philosophy:**
- Write tests first, see them fail, implement minimum to pass
- Start with orchestrator (outer), then sub-agents (inner)
- Focus on structure + contracts (not behavior)

**BDD Order (Outer to Inner):**
```
Outer Layer: Orchestrator Tests
     ↓
     Agent Structure Tests
     ↓
     JSON Schema Tests
     ↓
Inner Layer: Workflow Logic Tests
```

Start with the outermost boundary (orchestrator) and progressively work inward to agents and schemas. Each layer is tested before moving to the next.

### The Test Layers Pyramid

Pairing Buddy's testing strategy uses a custom "pyramid" based on **validation layers**, not the classic unit/integration/E2E pyramid:

```
            /\
           /  \     Workflow Layer
          /----\    (References resolve to registered agents)
         /      \
        /--------\   Schema Sync Layer
       /          \  (Agent inline schemas = canonical schemas)

                          (Files exist, valid frontmatter, sections in order)
```

| Layer | What It Validates | How |
|-------|-------------------|-----|
| **Structure** | Files exist, valid frontmatter, sections in order | YAML parsing, section detection |
| **Plugin** | plugin.json references valid files | Path existence checks |
| **Schemas** | JSON schemas valid, version pinned | jsonschema validation |
| **Schema Sync** | Agent inline schemas = canonical schemas | Verbatim comparison |
| **Workflow** | References resolve to registered agents | AST parsing |

**Why this approach?**
- Agents are LLM-driven - testing their "behavior" isn't deterministic
- Structure is deterministic and validates the system can be assembled correctly
- Call order is implicitly validated by data flow - each agent's input must come from a prior agent's output

### Contract-Driven Development

Every agent has explicit input/output schemas defined in `agent-config.yaml`:

```yaml
implement-tests:
  inputs:
    current_batch:
      schema: current-batch.schema.json
      file: .pairingbuddy/current-batch.json
    test_config:
      schema: test-config.schema.json
      file: .pairingbuddy/test-config.json
  outputs:
    test_state:
      schema: test-state.schema.json
      file: .pairingbuddy/test-state.json
```

**Benefits:**
- Agents are self-documenting
- Contracts are testable
- State flow is explicit
- Debugging is easier (inspect JSON files)

### Test Catalog

**Orchestrator Tests:**
| Test | What It Validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `test_orchestrator_exists` | Skill file exists at expected path |
| `test_orchestrator_frontmatter` | Valid YAML, required fields (name, description) |
| `test_orchestrator_sections` | Has required sections in order |
| `test_workflow_is_valid_python` | Workflow section parses as Python |
| `test_workflow_references_resolve` | Function calls map to agents in agent-config.yaml |

**Agent Tests:**
| Test | What It Validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `test_agent_exists` | Each agent file exists and registered in plugin.json |
| `test_agent_frontmatter` | Valid YAML, required fields (name, description, model, color) |
| `test_agent_sections_order` | Has sections in order: Purpose, Input, Instructions, Output |
| `test_agent_color_matches_config` | Agent color matches expected value from config |
| `test_agent_model_matches_config` | Agent model matches expected value from config |
| `test_agent_skills_match_config` | Agent skills match expected list from config |
| `test_agent_skill_references_resolve` | Agent skills reference existing skill directories |
| `test_agent_schemas_match` | Agent inline schemas match canonical schema files |
| `test_agent_definitions_match` | Test terminology consistent across agents |
| `test_agent_section_content_matches_canonical` | Canonical content (focus_warning, human_review) matches config |

**Schema Tests:**
| Test | What It Validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `test_schema_valid` | Schema files are valid JSON Schema |
| `test_schema_version` | Schema declares expected $schema version |
| `test_plugin_json_files_exist` | All agent/skill paths in plugin.json point to existing files |

**Skill Tests:**
| Test | What It Validates |
|------|-------------------|
| `test_skill_frontmatter` | Skill frontmatter validates against schema |
| `test_skill_sections` | Skill has required sections per category |
| `test_skill_directories` | Skill directories validate against schema |
| `test_file_references_exist` | All markdown links point to existing files |
| `test_skill_references_valid` | All skill references are valid |

### What We Test vs What We Don't

| What We Test | How |
|--------------|-----|
| Structure | Files exist, valid frontmatter, sections in order |
| Plugin | plugin.json references valid files |
| Schemas | JSON schemas valid, version pinned |
| Schema Sync | Agent inline schemas = canonical schemas |
| Workflow | References resolve to registered agents |
| Definitions | Terminology consistent across test-related agents |
| Human Review | Review content consistent across applicable agents |

| What We DON'T Test | Why |
|--------------------|-----|
| Agent behavior | LLM-driven, not deterministic |
| Call order | Implicitly validated by data flow |
| Mock execution | Deferred - real validation happens at integration |

**Note on data flow validation:** If agent A outputs `scenarios.json` and agent B expects `scenarios.json` as input, correct operation of the workflow implies correct ordering. This is validated at runtime, not through unit tests.

## Extensibility

### Design for Extension

The WHAT vs HOW separation enables extensibility without modifying agents:

**Current state:**
```
Agent (WHAT)           →    Skill (HOW)
implement-tests.md     →    writing-tests/python.md
```

**Extended state:**
```
Agent (WHAT)           →    Skill (HOW)
implement-tests.md     →    writing-tests/python.md
                       →    writing-tests/java.md (new)
                       →    writing-tests/javascript.md (new)
```

### Adding Language/Framework Support

To add support for a new language (e.g., Java):

1. **Add language-specific skill file:**
   ```
   skills/writing-tests/java.md
   ```

2. **Update SKILL.md Contents section:**
   ```markdown
   ## Contents
   - [Python & pytest](./python.md)
   - [Java & JUnit](./java.md)  # NEW
   ```

3. **No agent changes required** - agents describe WHAT, skills provide HOW.

**Language-specific files include:**
- Placeholder syntax (e.g., `pytest.fail("TODO: ...")` vs `throw new Error("TODO: ...")`)
- Naming conventions (e.g., `test_` prefix, file patterns)
- File organization (e.g., one file per scenario, folder structure)
- Framework-specific patterns

### Future Extensions

**Planned skills:**
- using-git-worktrees - Isolated feature development

**Planned features:**
- Legacy code test coverage skill
- Batch RED-GREEN execution for performance
- YAML state files (optimization)
- Item-by-item human review (vs whole-list)

**Potential extensions:**
- Design pattern recognition and application
- Architecture-aware test generation
- Performance testing integration
- Security testing patterns
- Domain-specific testing strategies (e.g., robotics, avionics)

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Flat Agent Structure

**Problem:** Previous nested skill structure had 4+ levels of indirection, causing slowness and erratic behavior.

**Solution:** Self-contained agents that communicate via JSON state files. Each agent reads input JSON, performs one atomic operation, writes output JSON.

### 2. Python Pseudocode for Workflows

The orchestrator defines workflow as valid Python code:
```python
scenarios = enumerate_scenarios_and_test_cases(task, test_config)
tests = create_test_placeholders(scenarios, test_config, gaps)
for test in _filter_pending(tests):
    current_batch = [test]
    test_state = implement_tests(current_batch, test_config)
    # ...
```

**Benefits:**
- Parseable logic (not just prose)
- Testable with mocks
- Executable documentation
- Claude can interpret and execute the flow

### 3. Convention Over Configuration

Function names in pseudocode map directly to agent names:
- `enumerate_scenarios_and_test_cases()` → agent `enumerate-scenarios-and-test-cases`
- Underscores in Python → hyphens in agent names

### 4. Single Source of Truth

Configuration lives in `contracts/`:
- `agent-config.yaml` - Agent structure, colors, models, sections, schemas
- `skill-config.yaml` - Skill structure requirements
- `test-terminology.yaml` - Shared definitions across agents

Tests validate that implementations match these contracts.

### 5. Agent Focus and Human Review

**Focus Warning:** All 29 agents include a "laser-focused" warning in their Instructions section to prevent agents from anticipating next steps or doing work that belongs to other agents. This warning is defined canonically in `agent-config.yaml` and tested for verbatim presence.

**Human Review Checkpoints:** Fourteen TDD/spike/planning agents pause for human review before proceeding (design-ux agents use orchestrator-level human interaction instead):
1. curate-guidance
2. enumerate-scenarios-and-test-cases
3. create-test-placeholders
4. identify-test-issues
5. identify-code-issues
6. verify-test-coverage
7. scope-refactoring
8. update-documentation
9. setup-spike
10. explore-spike-unit
11. brainstorm-requirements
12. solidify-architecture
13. decompose-tracer-bullets
14. sequence-tasks

**Workflow Pattern (Step 1-4):**

All agents with human review follow an explicit 4-step workflow in their Instructions section:

| Step | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Step 1: Read Inputs** | Read all input JSON files, always including `human-guidance.json`. Apply prior guidance. |
| **Step 2: Main Work** | Agent-specific analysis (enumerate scenarios, identify issues, etc.) |
| **Step 3: Human Review** | Present findings, ask for approval. If feedback, go back to Step 2. |
| **Step 4: Output** | Write JSON output only after explicit approval. |

**Review Loop:**
1. Agent presents findings and asks for approval
2. If human provides feedback:
   - Agent **immediately** appends to `human-guidance.json`
   - Agent redoes Step 2 with the new guidance
   - Agent presents revised findings and asks again
3. Loop continues until human explicitly approves or terminates

**Critical:** Agents do NOT proceed to output after receiving feedback - they must redo their analysis and present again. This ensures human corrections are actually applied.

**Feedback persistence:** When the human provides corrections, agents append the feedback to `human-guidance.json`. All agents read this file as input (Step 1), so corrections given to one agent are visible to all subsequent agents. This prevents the human from having to repeat the same guidance across multiple agents.

### 6. State File Cleanup and Persistence

At the start of each task, the orchestrator runs `_cleanup_state_files()` to delete stale state from previous tasks. This happens after `curate_guidance` but before `classify_task`.

**Files that persist across tasks:**
| File | Why It Persists |
|------|-----------------|
| `test-config.json` | Project-specific test runner configuration |
| `doc-config.json` | Documentation locations |
| `human-guidance.json` | Persistent operational knowledge (entries with `persistent: true`) |
| `plan/plan-config.json` | Plan name, output path, existing docs (persists across plans) |

**All other files are deleted:**
- `task.json`, `task-classification.json`
- `scenarios.json`, `tests.json`, `current-batch.json`
- `test-state.json`, `code-state.json`
- `test-issues.json`, `code-issues.json`, `files-changed.json`
- `coverage-report.json`, `all-tests-results.json`, `commit-result.json`
- `spike-config.json`, `spike-questions.json`, `spike-findings.json`, `spike-summary.json`, `current-unit.json`
- `docs-updated.json`

**Why this matters:**
- Stale state from previous tasks can cause incorrect behavior (e.g., old spike files causing confusion)
- Test configuration is project-specific, not task-specific - human validates once, reuses many times
- Human guidance with `persistent: true` captures operational knowledge that applies across tasks

## Solo Mode

Solo Buddy is an autonomous execution mode where Pairing Buddy executes a pre-established plan without human interaction.

### Entry Point

`scripts/solo-buddy.sh` launches a `claude -p` session with `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO=true`. The script unsets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` by default to prevent unexpected API billing (use `--use-api-key` to opt in). The prompt tells Claude to use `/pairingbuddy:code` to execute the plan.

### How It Works

Four components are Solo-aware:

1. **Shell script** (`scripts/solo-buddy.sh`) — Sets env var, invokes `claude -p --dangerously-skip-permissions --output-format json`. On success, creates a GitHub PR via `gh pr create` using the sanitized branch name as the title and `SOLO_BUDDY_REPORT.md` as the body when present
2. **Guardian hook** (`hooks/guardian.mjs`) — Detects `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO`, injects Solo constraint prompt on SessionStart, uses halved injection interval (2.5 min) and short Solo reminder for PostToolUse
3. **15 agents** — Agents with AskUserQuestion (Step 3 Human Review) check `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO` and skip review, assuming approval
4. **Coding orchestrator** (`skills/coding/SKILL.md`) — `_ask_human` auto-returns `true` in Solo mode. Solo Mode section defines strict scope, sequential execution, resource exhaustion before stopping, bug handling, quality compliance, report generation, and push-to-remote

### Report

Solo sessions produce `.pairingbuddy/SOLO_BUDDY_REPORT.md` incrementally — header at session start, task entry after each completion, stopped entry when blocked. The `_update_solo_report` function in the workflow pseudocode ensures report generation is a first-class workflow step.

### Observability

Solo sessions run unattended, so real-time progress visibility is essential. Two mechanisms provide observability:

**Guardian-based tracking (primary, reliable):**
- The guardian hook (`hooks/guardian.mjs`) writes agent info to its session file (`.pairingbuddy/hooks/{sessionId}.json`) on every PostToolUse call: `lastTool`, `lastAgent`, `lastDescription`
- The terminal renderer reads this file directly to show the current agent

**Progress hook (secondary, append-only log):**
- `hooks/solo-progress.mjs` filters for Agent tool invocations and appends timestamped entries to `.pairingbuddy/solo-progress.log` for post-session analysis
- This hook can be unreliable (PostToolUse hooks may stop firing after screen lock or VPN disruption), so the terminal display does not depend on it

**Terminal renderer:**
- `solo-buddy.sh` starts a background process that builds the display by reading source-of-truth files directly:
  - Plan MD file → checkbox count for progress bar and task list
  - `.pairingbuddy/task.json` → current task description
  - Guardian session file → current agent name and proof of life
- Renders a styled display with colored progress bar, task list (✓ done, → current, ○ pending), spinner on active task, and agent name
- Output is written to `/dev/tty` so it remains visible even when `claude -p` stdout is captured
- The renderer cleans up gracefully when the solo session ends (no orphan processes)
- On completion, displays final status with 100% progress bar and PR/report links

**Design constraints:**
- Terminal display is independent of the solo-progress hook — it reads source files directly via the shell renderer
- Guardian file write is wrapped in try/catch to never affect prompt injection reliability
- No-op when `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO` is not set (zero impact on interactive sessions)

### macOS Sleep Prevention

Solo Buddy uses `caffeinate -s` to prevent macOS from suspending the process when the screen locks. Without it, macOS App Nap freezes the terminal process entirely. Claude Code's built-in `caffeinate -i` only prevents idle sleep, not display/system sleep triggered by screen lock. The caffeinate process is cleaned up via the exit trap.

### Operational Notes

- **macOS only** — Solo Buddy currently only works on macOS (caffeinate, /dev/tty assumptions)
- **VPN interference** — VPN causes sessions to terminate after 1-4 tasks due to connection timeouts. Disable VPN before running. Without VPN, 29-task plans complete in a single session
- **Output format** — Must use `--output-format json`. The `text` format causes early session termination after 1 task
- **API key safety** — The script unsets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` by default. If present in the environment, it silently overrides Max/Pro subscription billing. Use `--use-api-key` only for explicit API billing
- **Session resumability** — Plan MD checkboxes are the durable state. Restarting the script picks up from the first unchecked task. The report preserves entries from previous sessions and reconciles against the current plan

### Key Design Properties

- **No workflow pseudocode changes** — Solo behavior comes from `_ask_human` auto-yes and the Solo Mode instructions section
- **Sequential execution** — on task failure, the session stops (no skip-ahead)
- **No revert on stop** — uncommitted changes stay as-is for human review
- **Never pushes to main/master** — only pushes to the branch the human set up

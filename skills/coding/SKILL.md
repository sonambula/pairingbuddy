# Coding Orchestrator

Orchestrates the TDD workflow by invoking specialized agents via the Task tool and workflows via the Workflow tool. Each agent reads input JSON, performs one operation, writes output JSON.

## CRITICAL: Follow the Workflow Exactly

**You MUST follow the workflow pseudocode exactly as specified.** Do not skip steps, reorder agents, or deviate from the sequence. The workflow exists because each agent depends on the output of prior agents.

If you think a step doesn't apply, you are probably wrong. The workflow handles edge cases. Follow it.

## State File Mappings

State files live in `.pairingbuddy/` at the git root of the target project.

| Variable | File | Schema |
|----------|------|--------|
| task | .pairingbuddy/task.json | task.schema.json |
| test_config | .pairingbuddy/test-config.json | test-config.schema.json |
| human_guidance | .pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json | human-guidance.schema.json |
| scenarios | .pairingbuddy/scenarios.json | scenarios.schema.json |
| tests | .pairingbuddy/tests.json | tests.schema.json |
| current_batch | .pairingbuddy/current-batch.json | current-batch.schema.json |
| test_state | .pairingbuddy/test-state.json | test-state.schema.json |
| code_state | .pairingbuddy/code-state.json | code-state.schema.json |
| test_issues | .pairingbuddy/test-issues.json | issues.schema.json |
| code_issues | .pairingbuddy/code-issues.json | issues.schema.json |
| files_changed | .pairingbuddy/files-changed.json | files-changed.schema.json |
| coverage_report | .pairingbuddy/coverage-report.json | coverage-report.schema.json |
| all_tests_results | .pairingbuddy/all-tests-results.json | all-tests-results.schema.json |
| commit_result | .pairingbuddy/commit-result.json | commit-result.schema.json |
| spike_config | .pairingbuddy/spike-config.json | spike-config.schema.json |
| spike_questions | .pairingbuddy/spike-questions.json | spike-questions.schema.json |
| spike_findings | .pairingbuddy/spike-findings.json | spike-findings.schema.json |
| spike_summary | .pairingbuddy/spike-summary.json | spike-summary.schema.json |
| current_unit | .pairingbuddy/current-unit.json | current-unit.schema.json |
| doc_config | .pairingbuddy/doc-config.json | doc-config.schema.json |
| docs_updated | .pairingbuddy/docs-updated.json | docs-updated.schema.json |

## How to Execute This Workflow

The Workflow section below contains Python pseudocode - a specification, not executable code. This section explains how to interpret and execute it.

### Reading the Pseudocode

- **Function calls** map to agent invocations (Task tool), except `Workflow('pairingbuddy:<name>', args=X)` calls, which map to Workflow tool calls (see Invoking Workflows)
- **Variable names** map to JSON file paths (see State File Mappings)
- **Underscores** in function names become **hyphens** in agent names
  - `enumerate_scenarios_and_test_cases()` → agent `enumerate-scenarios-and-test-cases`

### Agent Invocation

Each agent function call (not a `Workflow(...)` call) translates to a Task tool invocation:

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: pairingbuddy:<agent-name>
```

Agents are self-contained - they know what to read (Input section), what to do (Instructions), and what to write (Output section). No prompt needed.

### Invoking Workflows

`Workflow('pairingbuddy:<name>', args=X)` is a call to the Workflow tool, not a Task-tool agent:

```
Workflow tool:
  name: "pairingbuddy:<name>"
  args: X
```

- If the tool reports the name as unknown, retry with `scriptPath` pointing at the plugin's `workflows/<name>.js`: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/workflows/<name>.js`, or, if that variable is not substituted, relative to this skill's base directory. Never fall back to the Task tool.
- Wait for the result and bind it to the assigned variable (e.g. `classification`).
- Variables not listed in State File Mappings are in-context values, not files. `task` is the in-context task object; `task.json` is written only by the TEMPORARY BRIDGE in the Workflow section.

### Control Flow

Interpret control flow statements as orchestration logic:

- `for test in tests:` → Read tests.json, iterate over each test entry
- `test_issues = identify_test_issues(...)` then `if test_issues:` → Invoke agent, then check if test-issues.json contains items
- `while condition:` → Loop until condition is false

### Orchestrator Functions

Functions prefixed with `_` are **orchestrator logic**, not agent calls. The orchestrator implements these directly:

| Function | Behavior |
|----------|----------|
| `_cleanup_state_files()` | **MANDATORY.** Delete ALL `.pairingbuddy/*.json` files EXCEPT: `test-config.json`, `doc-config.json`, `human-guidance.json`. These three files persist across tasks. All other state files (task.json, scenarios.json, tests.json, spike-*.json, etc.) MUST be deleted to start fresh. This prevents stale state from previous tasks from affecting the current task. |
| `_filter_pending(tests)` | Filter tests.json to return only tests not yet processed in this session |
| `_filter_pending(spike_questions)` | Filter spike-questions.json units to return only units with status "pending" |
| `_mark_unit_answered(spike_questions, unit_id)` | Update unit status to "answered" in spike-questions.json |
| `_ask_human(question)` | **Interactive mode:** Present question to human, return true/false based on response. **Solo mode** (`PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO=true`): Return `true` for all checkpoints (auto-yes). Exception: if the orchestrator has tracked N consecutive retry failures on the current task (where N = `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO_MAX_RETRIES` env var, default 5), return `false` to trigger a stop. |
| `_stop(message)` | Stop workflow execution and report message to human. In Solo mode, also write the stop reason to `.pairingbuddy/SOLO_BUDDY_REPORT.md` (see Solo Mode section below). |
| `_detect_plan_file(task)` | Check if the task description references a plan MD file path. Returns true if a plan file is detected. |
| `_read_plan_tasks(plan_path)` | Parse the plan MD, extract tasks with their checkbox state (checked/unchecked), index, title, and full description |
| `_next_unchecked_task(plan_tasks)` | Return the first unchecked task from the parsed plan tasks |
| `_mark_task_complete(plan_path, task_index)` | Update `- [ ]` to `- [x]` in the MD file for the given task index |
| `_hydrate_claude_tasks(plan_tasks)` | Create Claude Code Tasks (TaskCreate) for all plan tasks, marking completed ones. Provides in-session visibility. |
| `_update_claude_task(task_id)` | Mark a Claude Code Task as completed (TaskUpdate) |
| `_update_solo_report(event, details)` | **Solo mode only.** Create or append to `.pairingbuddy/SOLO_BUDDY_REPORT.md`. Called with event `"start"` (creates file if absent; on resume, **reconciles** existing entries against the current plan — drops entries for removed tasks, reorders to match plan, then appends session separator), `"task_complete"` (appends task entry), or `"stopped"` (appends stop entry, updates header). See Solo Mode section for report template. No-op in interactive mode. |
| `_absolute_project_root()` | Return the absolute git root of the target project, i.e. the directory that holds `.pairingbuddy/` (e.g. `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`). Never a relative path. |
| `_file_exists(path)` | Return true if the file exists (paths relative to the project root) |
| `_read_json(path)` | Read and parse the JSON file, return its contents |
| `_write_json(path, data)` | Serialize `data` as JSON and write it to the file |

These functions handle coordination, human interaction, and control flow that doesn't belong in agents.

## Workflow

**Prerequisites:** Before starting, ensure `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json` exists. See "Bootstrap test-config.json" in Orchestrator Behavior.

### Task Type Definitions

| Task Type | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **new_feature** | Adding new functionality that requires new tests | "Add user authentication" |
| **bug_fix** | Fixing incorrect behavior with a regression test | "Fix login failing for users with spaces in email" |
| **refactoring** | Improving code structure, no behavior change | "Extract payment logic into separate module" |
| **config_change** | Changing configuration values only | "Update API timeout to 30s" |
| **spike** | Exploratory coding to answer questions, compare approaches, or evaluate technologies. No tests, throwaway code. | "Compare Redis vs Postgres for session storage" |

## Orchestrator Behavior

### Bootstrap test-config.json

1. Check if `.pairingbuddy/test-config.json` exists
2. If exists, ask human: "Use existing test config?" (show current config)
3. If missing or human says no, infer from: README, CLAUDE.md, plan docs, project structure
4. Validate inferred config with human before writing
5. If unable to infer, ask human directly

### State File Management

1. At cycle start, verify `.pairingbuddy/` is in `.gitignore`
2. Invoke `curate_guidance` agent (before cleanup):
   - If `human-guidance.json` has entries: review/curate existing guidance
   - If empty or missing: offer to add new persistent guidance
   - Approved entries get `"persistent": true` flag
3. Delete all `.pairingbuddy/*.json` EXCEPT `test-config.json`, `doc-config.json`, and `human-guidance.json`
4. If `human-guidance.json` doesn't exist after curation, initialize with `{"guidance": []}`
5. Keep files after run for human review

**Note:** `human-guidance.json` serves two purposes:
- **Session feedback:** Agents with Human Review checkpoints append corrections during the task
- **Persistent guidance:** Entries with `"persistent": true` survive cleanup and carry over to future tasks (operational knowledge, coding preferences, project conventions)

### Human Checkpoints

After each refactor cycle:
1. Present issues found to human
2. Human decides: continue, skip remaining, or stop
3. Prevents infinite refactor loops

### Task Classification Workflow

Task classification runs as the `pairingbuddy:classify` workflow, started with the Workflow tool right after `_cleanup_state_files()`, in both the plan-execution path and the normal path. The `task_type` that routes the rest of the workflow is read from the workflow result.

The `project_root` argument is always an absolute path to the project root. The `human_guidance` argument is read from `.pairingbuddy/human-guidance.json` if it exists, and is omitted from the arguments when that file does not exist.

The classification result is held in context, and `task-classification.json` is no longer written.

**Temporary bridge:** The flows that follow classification have not been migrated to workflows yet, and they still read `task.json`. The bridge is therefore scoped to `UNMIGRATED_FLOWS`, which currently lists all five task types (`new_feature`, `bug_fix`, `refactoring`, `config_change` and `spike`). Whenever `task_type` is in `UNMIGRATED_FLOWS`, the orchestrator writes `task.json` after classification, with one rule for the plan-execution path and the normal path. As each flow migrates, its task type leaves `UNMIGRATED_FLOWS`, and the whole bridge is removed in TB3.3.

### Plan Execution Mode

When the task description references a plan MD file (produced by `/pairingbuddy:plan`), the orchestrator enters plan execution mode:

1. **Detection:** `_detect_plan_file(task)` checks if the task references a `.md` file that contains plan-formatted content (TB headings with checkbox tasks)
2. **Parsing:** `_read_plan_tasks(plan_path)` extracts all tasks from the plan MD with their checkbox state, title, and full description
3. **Visibility:** `_hydrate_claude_tasks(plan_tasks)` creates Claude Code Tasks (via TaskCreate) for all plan tasks. Completed tasks (checked) are marked as done. This gives the human a visible progress view within the session.
4. **Iteration:** For each unchecked task, the orchestrator:
   a. Holds the plan task's rich description as the task, and writes `task.json` only when `task_type in UNMIGRATED_FLOWS` (the temporary bridge described below)
   b. Runs the normal TDD workflow (curate guidance, cleanup, classify, implement)
   c. After successful completion, updates the MD checkbox (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`)
   d. Marks the Claude Code Task as completed
   e. Pauses for human confirmation before continuing to the next task
5. **Cross-session recovery:** On a new session, the human says "continue executing plan at path/to/plan.md". The orchestrator reads the MD — checkboxes show what's done. It hydrates Claude Code Tasks from the current state and continues from the first unchecked task.

**Note:** Claude Code Tasks are session-scoped (they don't persist across sessions). The MD checkboxes are the durable source of truth. Claude Code Tasks are hydrated fresh each session from the MD state.

### Resume and Plan Modifications

Sessions may be interrupted and resumed. The plan MD checkboxes are the sole source of truth — on resume, the orchestrator reads them and continues from the first unchecked task.

**Plan modifications between sessions:** The human may modify the plan MD between runs:
- **Add** new unchecked tasks (at the end or between existing tasks)
- **Remove** unchecked tasks that are no longer needed
- **Modify** unchecked task descriptions
- **Do not modify** checked tasks — they represent completed work with committed code

The orchestrator reads the plan fresh each session, so modifications take effect immediately.

### Error Handling

1. If agent returns error or invalid output → stop and report
2. If `implement_code` fails to make test pass → retry once with different approach (try prompting)
3. If retry fails → ask human how to proceed

### Solo Mode

When `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO` environment variable is `true`, the orchestrator operates autonomously. The workflow pseudocode above is **unchanged** — Solo behavior comes entirely from `_ask_human` auto-yes (see Orchestrator Functions table) and the instructions below.

**Detection:** Check `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO` env var at workflow start. If `true`, Solo mode is active.

**Strict scope**
- Every action must be traceable to an explicit rule in skills, contracts, or the plan
- No additions, no improvements, no "while I'm here" moments
- If rules don't cover the situation: STOP and document the gap
- No "best judgment" decisions

**Sequential execution**
- On task failure, the plan execution loop must `break` (not `continue`)
- The orchestrator MUST NOT skip to the next task
- Stopping ensures the human reviews the situation

**Resource exhaustion before stopping**
Before stopping a Solo session due to a failure or ambiguity (not on normal completion or token exhaustion):
1. Re-read the relevant skill reference files
2. Re-read contracts and architecture docs
3. Check if `CLAUDE.md` or project-specific docs have relevant guidance
4. Only stop if the path forward is still unclear after all resources are consulted
5. Document which resources were consulted in the stop report

**Bug handling**
- **Blocker bug for current task:** Fix it using the bug fix workflow. It's a dependency, not out of scope.
- **Bug in code being touched by current task:** Fix it. Consistent with quality standards.
- **Bug in unrelated code discovered by accident:** Log it in `SOLO_BUDDY_REPORT.md` but do NOT fix it. Not in scope.

**Quality compliance**
- Fix ALL issues flagged by quality agents (`identify-test-issues`, `identify-code-issues`). No exceptions.
- The orchestrator MUST NOT rationalize skipping a quality issue by claiming scope boundaries.
- If a quality agent flags it, it gets fixed — period.

**Uncommitted changes on stop**
- On session stop, uncommitted changes are left as-is in the worktree
- No `git checkout .`, `git clean`, or any form of revert

**Report generation**
Create or append to `.pairingbuddy/SOLO_BUDDY_REPORT.md` incrementally:

1. **At session start** (after first task begins):
   - **If the report does NOT exist**, create it with header:
     ```markdown
     # Solo Buddy Report

     - **Plan:** <path to plan file>
     - **Branch:** <current git branch name>
     - **Started:** <ISO 8601 timestamp>
     - **Tasks completed:** 0 of N
     - **Status:** in_progress

     ## Tasks
     ```
   - **If the report ALREADY exists** (resume), reconcile then append:
     1. Read the current plan MD to get the current task list (by title)
     2. Parse existing report task entries (`### Task N: <title>`)
     3. **Drop** entries whose task title no longer appears in the current plan (removed/replaced tasks)
     4. **Reorder** remaining entries to match the current plan's task order
     5. Rewrite the report with: preserved header, reconciled task entries, then append session separator:
     ```markdown

     ---

     ## Session resumed

     - **Resumed:** <ISO 8601 timestamp>
     - **Tasks remaining:** X of Y unchecked
     - **Status:** in_progress
     ```
     Task matching uses the task title text (after `- [x]` or `- [ ]` in the plan, after `### Task N:` in the report). This ensures the report always reflects the current plan — no stale entries from previous plan versions.

2. **After each task completes**, append a task entry:
   ```markdown
   ### Task N: <title>
   - **Status:** completed
   - **Commits:** <commit hashes with messages>
   - **Decisions made:** <decisions made during this task>
   - **Quality issues fixed:** <issues flagged and fixed>
   ```

3. **On session stop**, append a stopped entry and update the header:
   ```markdown
   ## Stopped

   - **Task:** <which task it stopped on>
   - **Reason:** <why it stopped>
   - **What was tried:** <approaches attempted>
   - **Resources consulted:** <skills, contracts, docs checked>
   - **What the human needs to do:** <actionable next steps>
   ```

**Push to remote**
After session ends (completion or stop):
1. Push the current branch to remote with `git push`
2. **NEVER push to main/master** — Solo Buddy only pushes to the branch the human set up
3. If push fails, log the failure but don't stop — the work is already committed locally

Note: `SOLO_BUDDY_REPORT.md` lives in `.pairingbuddy/` which is gitignored. It is a local artifact for the human to review, not committed to the repository.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Workflow block generator `scripts/generate_workflow_blocks.py` (dynamic workflows migration, TB1.1 Tasks 1-2)
  - Run with `uv run python scripts/generate_workflow_blocks.py [--schemas-dir DIR] [--workflows-dir DIR] [--check] [paths...]`; with no paths it processes every `*.js` in the workflows dir (default `workflows/`)
  - Fills `<generated:schemas name...>` marker blocks with `const UPPER_SNAKE = <json>` loaded from `contracts/schemas/<name>.schema.json`; strips `$schema` and `$id`, preserves the source file's key order (not sorted), 2-space indent
  - Only the text between markers is rewritten (byte-preserving outside; unchanged files are not rewritten)
  - `--check` writes nothing and reports `stale: <path>`
  - Per-file errors (unknown, invalid or unreadable schema; misordered, nested or unclosed markers; unreadable or unwritable target; missing workflows dir) are reported and the run continues; exit 2 on any error, else 1 if stale in `--check`, else 0
  - Fills `<generated:helper>` blocks verbatim from `scripts/workflow_helper.js.tmpl` (args normalization, `requireArgs`, `projectRoot`, WORKFLOW MODE preamble, `block()`, `run()`); `agentType` appears only in `run()`, so in one generated place
  - Strict marker syntax: the helper marker takes no arguments, the schemas marker needs at least one name, and any other opening is an error naming the line (exit 2)
  - An unreadable helper template is a per-file error; `--check` covers helper blocks; helper and schemas blocks coexist in one file
  - Tests in `tests/scripts/test_generate_workflow_blocks.py` (including 15 helper-block test cases)
- `workflows/classify.js`: first production workflow (dynamic workflows migration, TB1.1 Task 3)
  - Classifies a task via `run('classify-task')` using the generated helper and `task-classification` schema blocks; `meta` documents the args in `whenToUse`
- Structural test suite `tests/workflows/`, applied automatically to every `workflows/*.js`
  - Syntax check run as an async-function body (`node --check` on a file with `export` is vacuous on Node 24)
  - Agent names (`pairingbuddy:<x>` agentTypes and `run('<x>')` literals) resolve to `contracts/agent-config.yaml`
  - `meta` has `name`, `description`, `whenToUse` and non-empty `phases`; `meta.name` matches the file stem
  - Generated blocks are in sync (via the generator's `process_path`); spike files `bug-fix-pilot.js` and `spike-probe.js` are tolerated, with a per-file `whenToUse` exemption until TB5.1
  - Regex structural checks normalize formatting and anchor to their construct, validated by mutation probes

### Changed

- Node.js >= 18 is now a hard requirement for the plugin (hooks) and its tests: `tests/conftest.py` stops the session with a clear message when node is missing or too old, and no test skips for lack of node (supersedes the earlier skip rule)
- pytest `pythonpath = ["."]` so tests can import the shared `tests.js_syntax` helper; the generator's helper `node --check` test now uses it

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added

- Solo Buddy: autonomous execution mode via `scripts/solo-buddy.sh`
  - Shell script entry point with `claude -p`, env var signal, API key safety (unsets `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` by default)
  - Guardian hook Solo mode: halved injection cadence (2 min), Solo constraint prompt on SessionStart
  - 15 agents with Solo Mode section: skip Step 3 Human Review when `PAIRINGBUDDY_SOLO=true`
  - Coding orchestrator Solo mode: `_ask_human` auto-yes, strict scope, sequential execution, resource exhaustion before stopping, bug handling, quality compliance
  - `SOLO_BUDDY_REPORT.md` incremental report generation with session resumability
  - Push-to-remote and GitHub PR creation on success via `gh pr create`
- Solo Buddy observability
  - Live terminal renderer: styled progress bar, task list (✓/→/○), spinner on active task, colored agent names
  - Guardian-based agent tracking: guardian writes `lastAgent`/`lastTool`/`lastDescription` to session file on every tool call
  - Renderer reads source files directly (plan MD, task.json, guardian session file) — independent of hook reliability
  - `hooks/solo-progress.mjs`: append-only progress log for post-session analysis
  - Current test file surfaced in `solo-status` and the progress log, read from `current-batch.json` with `tests.json` as fallback
  - Final 100% status display on completion with PR/report links
- `caffeinate -s` sleep prevention for macOS (prevents App Nap/system sleep during unattended runs)
- Report reconciliation on resume: preserves entries from previous sessions, drops stale entries for tasks removed from plan, maintains correct ordering
- Branch guard: refuses to push/create PR on main/master

### Changed

- `committing-changes` skill: added "What Not to Include" section covering no AI co-author trailers, no auto-formatting noise, and no "tests pass" notes (only call out skipped/failing tests)

### Fixed

- `hooks/solo-progress.mjs`: exits cleanly when `.pairingbuddy/` directory is absent
- `solo-buddy.sh`: `stop_caffeinate` runs first in cleanup to prevent orphan processes
- `solo-buddy.sh`: `require_positive_number` rejects all zero representations
- `solo-buddy.sh`: push branch before `gh pr create` to avoid interactive prompt in headless mode
- Output format set to `json` — `text` format causes early session termination

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- Session drift guardian: time-based `PostToolUse` hook that re-injects workflow compliance reminders every 5 minutes of activity, plus always after context compaction (`SessionStart:compact`), to prevent the session agent from skipping steps, avoiding subagents, or doing agent work in the main context
- `/pairingbuddy:plan` command for tracer bullet planning workflow
  - Planning orchestrator skill with adaptive brainstorming, architecture management, tracer bullet decomposition, and task sequencing
  - Four planning agents:
    - brainstorm-requirements: adaptive Socratic exploration of requirements
    - solidify-architecture: analyze/create/update architecture documents
    - decompose-tracer-bullets: decompose into thin end-to-end tracer bullet slices
    - sequence-tasks: sequence tasks within TBs and write plan markdown document
  - Two new reference skills:
    - decomposing-tracer-bullets: tracer bullet methodology and thin E2E slicing patterns
    - sequencing-tasks: task sequencing for TDD-ready plans
  - Four new JSON schemas: plan-config, plan-requirements, plan-architecture, plan-tracer-bullets
  - Plan state isolated in `.pairingbuddy/plan/` (not affected by `/code` cleanup)
  - Plan resumability: detect existing plan, offer resume/re-plan/start fresh
- `/code` plan execution mode
  - Detects plan MD files and iterates through unchecked tasks
  - Claude Code Task visibility for in-session progress tracking
  - Automatic MD checkbox updates on task completion (`- [ ]` → `- [x]`)
  - Cross-session recovery via MD checkboxes (source of truth)
  - Human checkpoint between tasks

### Changed

- Convert all hooks from bash to Node.js for cross-platform compatibility
- Update using-pairingbuddy skill to reflect current architecture: three commands (/code, /plan, /design-ux), agent-based workflows, and commit step enforcement

### Fixed

- Agent output file reliability: agents with human review sometimes completed without writing output JSON files
  - Strengthened `workflow_step4_output` canonical block with mandatory verification step (read-back confirmation)
  - Removed 9 vague agent-specific one-liners ("After approval, write to X") that LLM agents misinterpreted as summaries
  - Affected agents: enumerate-scenarios-and-test-cases, identify-test-issues, identify-code-issues, brainstorm-requirements, solidify-architecture, decompose-tracer-bullets, scope-refactoring, verify-test-coverage, setup-spike
- Spike findings overwrite bug in explore-spike-unit agent: replaced vague append instruction with explicit read-modify-write steps to prevent losing previous units' findings

### Changed

- Agent count increased from 25 to 29
- Schema count increased from 35 to 39
- Skill count increased from 14 to 17 (3 orchestrators, 1 entry, 13 reference)
- Test count increased from ~881 to ~1037

    - critiquing-designs: 6-pass UX critique framework
    - building-components: component patterns and domain packs
    - generating-design-previews: preview and example HTML templates
    - generating-exploration-gallery: gallery and comparison templates
  - Fourteen new JSON schemas for design state management:
    - brand, design-artifacts, design-brief, design-critique, design-decisions
    - design-direction, design-experience-config, design-session
    - design-system-config, design-validation, domain-spec
    - exploration-status, gallery-output, tokens-generated
  - Design state lives in `.pairingbuddy/design-ux/{exploration-name}/`
  - Parallel exploration support with isolated session state
  - Web output: preview.html, example.html with Tailwind CDN and dark mode
  - Three-tier token architecture: global tokens → alias tokens → component tokens
  - Multi-brand architecture support via brand.schema.json

### Fixed

- Front-loaded file restrictions in explore-spike-unit to prevent /tmp writes
  - Moved file creation restrictions to start of Step 2 (before main work begins)
  - Previously restrictions came after instructions, causing LLM to create markdown files in /tmp

- Made state file cleanup explicit in workflow pseudocode
  - Added `_cleanup_state_files()` orchestrator function with crystal-clear description
  - Added mandatory call in workflow after `curate_guidance`, before `classify_task`
  - Previously cleanup was only described in prose, causing Claude to skip it

### Changed

- Agent count increased from 18 to 25
- Schema count increased from 21 to 35
- Skill count increased from 7 to 14 (2 orchestrators, 1 entry, 11 reference)
- Test count increased from ~565 to ~881

- Upgraded models for better task performance
  - implement-tests: haiku → sonnet (tests may require design decisions beyond mechanical translation)
  - refactor-tests: haiku → sonnet (consistency with refactor-code which was already sonnet)
  - explore-spike-unit: sonnet → opus (spikes involve complex research and exploration)
  - identify-test-issues: haiku → opus (critical quality gate - misses have compounding effects)
  - identify-code-issues: haiku → opus (critical quality gate - misses have compounding effects)

- Improved curate-guidance agent to show actual entries during human review

- Replaced `summarize-spike` agent with `document-spike` agent
  - Now MANDATORY at end of spike workflow (was optional)
  - Creates comprehensive documentation capturing ALL findings (not a summary that loses information)

- Improved Human Review step to require comprehensive descriptions
  - Updated canonical `workflow_step3_human_review` content block with explicit instructions
  - All 10 agents with Human Review updated to match new canonical content

- Added mandatory output file writing instructions to Step 4: Output
  - New canonical `workflow_step4_output` content block with explicit Write tool requirements
  - Three write modes: "Writes to" (overwrite), "Appends to" (read-add-write), "Updates" (read-modify-write)
  - All 10 agents with Step 4: Output updated to match new canonical content

## [0.4.0] - 2026-01-06

### Added

- curate-guidance agent for selective carry-over of human guidance between tasks
  - Analyzes existing guidance entries and classifies as task-specific (drop) or general (keep)
  - Proposes consolidation of similar entries into principles
  - Human checkpoint for approval with ability to modify or add new entries
  - Supports bootstrap mode when no existing guidance (offer to seed persistent guidance)
- Persistent guidance feature via `persistent` field in human-guidance.schema.json
  - Entries with `persistent: true` survive cleanup between tasks
  - Preserves operational knowledge (how to run tests, where to document, coding preferences)

### Changed

- Agent count increased from 17 to 18
- Human review checkpoint count increased from 9 to 10
- Updated orchestrator workflow to invoke curate-guidance before task classification
- human-guidance.json now persists across tasks (like test-config.json and doc-config.json)

## [0.3.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added

- update-documentation agent for keeping docs in sync with code changes
  - Analyzes code changes and identifies documentation needing updates
  - Supports both in-repo and external documentation locations
  - Human checkpoint before making updates

  - New docs-updated.json output for commit context
- Two new schemas: doc-config.schema.json, docs-updated.schema.json
- Agent count increased from 16 to 17
- Schema count increased from 19 to 21

### Changed

- Restructured Human Review workflow with explicit Step 1-4 pattern:
  - Step 1: Read Inputs (always includes human-guidance.json first)
  - Step 2: Main Work (agent-specific analysis)
  - Step 3: Human Review (with retry loop back to Step 2 on feedback)
  - Step 4: Output (only after explicit approval)
- Moved Human Review content into Step 3 (removed separate ## Human Review section)
- Added canonical content blocks: workflow_read_inputs, workflow_step3_human_review
- All 9 agents with Human Review now enforce: read guidance first, redo work after feedback, never proceed to output without approval
- Test count changed from ~500 to ~565
- Refactor agents (refactor-tests, refactor-code) now run targeted tests with verify-fix loop:
  - Run only modified test files or tests that exercise modified code (not entire suite)
  - Retry loop: if tests fail, analyze and fix before proceeding
  - Ask human operator if stuck after 3 attempts

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-17

### Added
